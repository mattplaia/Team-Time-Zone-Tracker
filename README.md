Team Time Zone Tracker

The Team Time Zone Tracker is a lightweight web tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help distributed teams visualize working hours across multiple time zones. Designed for clarity and simplicity, it provides a fixed 24-hour timeline (12:00 AM–11:59 PM) in the selected timezone, highlighting local operating hours and dynamically displaying team availability.

Features

Fixed Timeline Layout – Always displays a 24-hour day, ensuring consistency across all sections.

Operating Hours Highlight – Default 9 AM–6 PM window (viewer’s local time) displayed in gray.

Team Member Markers – Each person is represented by a colored marker positioned based on their working hours relative to the viewer’s timezone.

Hover-Based Overlays – Hovering on a marker reveals an overlay showing that member’s operating hours translated into the viewer’s local timezone.

Dynamic Status Updates – Each member’s legend box automatically updates to show “Online” or “Offline” based on the current time.

Live Current Time Pin – A red pin above the timeline shows the viewer’s real-time local hour, updating continuously.

Stacked Team Sections – Separate timelines for Creative & Content, Marketing Managers, Public Relations, and PMs/Ops (with potential to add more teams).

Clean Visual Design – Minimal, functional layout with a centered live clock beneath the page title, consistent use of colors, and a clear legend format.

Use Cases

Quickly see when teammates in different regions are online.

Plan meetings or deadlines across multiple time zones.

Provide a transparent, always-on reference for distributed departments.

Tech Stack
