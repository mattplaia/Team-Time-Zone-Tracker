# Team-Time-Zone-Tracker
A lightweight web tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help distributed teams visualize working hours across multiple time zones. Designed for clarity and simplicity, it provides a fixed 24-hour timeline (12:00 AMâ€“11:59 PM) in the selected timezone, highlighting local operating hours and dynamically displaying team availability.
